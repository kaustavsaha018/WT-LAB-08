<br>
<h2>Questions:</h2>

<h3>1. A plastic manufacturer sells plastic in different shapes like 2D sheet and 3D box. The cost of sheet is Rs 40/ per square ft. and the cost of box is Rs 60/ per cubic ft. Implement it in Java to calculate the cost of plastic as per the dimensions given by the user where 3D inherits from 2D.</h3>

<h3>2. Illustrate the execution of constructors in multi-level inheritance with three Java classes – plate(length, width), box(length, width, height), wood box (length, width, height, thick)</h3>

<h3>3. Program on Dynamic Method Dispatch.</h3>

<h3>4. Write a program in java to define a class Shape which has data member „area‟ and a member function showArea(). Derive two classes Circle and Rectangle from Shape class. Add appropriate data members and member functions to calculate and display the area of Circle and Rectangle.</h3>

<h3>5. Write a program to create an Account class containing acc_no, balance as data members and disp() to display the details. Inherit it in Person class with all mentioned data members and functions. Person class also has name and aadhar_no as extra data members of its own. Override disp() function. Create 5 persons‟ details.</h3>

<h3>6. Write a program in java using inheritance to show how to call the base class parameterized constructors from the derived class using super.</h3>
